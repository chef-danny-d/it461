            I'm Daniel B. Papp, A part time full stack developer and UI
            designer, as well as a full time student at Old Dominion University.
            Web component design and web application development is not only my
            specialty, but my passion, as they have been for over 6 years.

            How much do you know about HTML, JavaScript, and PHP? I have
            numerous years of experience in Web Development, including HTML and
            CSS. Due to my background in WordPress I have years of knowledge in
            PHP and MySQL. Recently I have been studying JavaScript more in
            depth with the use of React for front-end development as well as
            NodeJS for server design.

            How much do you know about databases such as MYSQL? As explained
            above I have background in MySQL due to WordPress, but I have also
            taken Computer Science classes that taught me more about database
            design.
